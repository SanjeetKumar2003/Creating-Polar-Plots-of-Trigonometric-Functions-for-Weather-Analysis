Problem Statement:

A meteorological research company wants to analyze wind patterns in a
coastal area.
They have collected data on wind direction and speed over a year.
Your task is to create a polar plot that visualizes this data using
trigonometric functions.
The company provides you with the following requirements:
Generate sample data for wind direction (in degrees) and wind speed (in
km/h) for 360 data points, representing a full year of daily measurements.
Convert the wind direction from degrees to radians for plotting.
Create a polar plot where:
The angle represents the wind direction
The radius represents the wind speed
Plot three different trigonometric functions to represent different aspects of
the wind data:
Use the sine function to create a pattern that emphasizes east-west winds
Use the cosine function to create a pattern that emphasizes north-south
winds
Use the tangent function to create a pattern that emphasizes diagonal winds
Add appropriate labels, a title, and a legend to the plot.
Ensure that the plot is visually appealing and easy to interpret.
Your code should generate the sample data and create the required polar
plot.
The goal is to practice Python data manipulation and visualization
techniques,
focusing on working with trigonometric functions and creating polar plots.
